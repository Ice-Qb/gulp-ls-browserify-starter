# gulp-livescript-browserify Starter Project

It's quite hard to work out how to get Gulp to work correctly with this setup,
and I got sick of figuring it out every time. Here's a starter project that
sets you up with a simple Connect server to serve your files,  and a browserify
module system all running in Livescript. Oh and Livereload because LR is like,
basically oxygen to me.


# Todo

- Improve error output
- Comprehensive error handling... gulp-plumber?
- Stylesheet compilation as well maybe
- Check whether livereload process can be improved
- Check whether any neat tricks exist to remove '.ls' from require calls


# License

GPL3 bitches, deal.
